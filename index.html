                <h2 class="article_subtitle">Civil rights leaders in the 1960s fought racism, poverty and war together. In 2019, we need to fight the same fight—seeking economic and social justice, but also fighting against a new nuclear arms race.</h2>

                <h1 class="article_title">Abstract</h1>
                <h2 class="article_subtitle">African Americans have long recognized the throughline of militarism in the United States and the nefarious ways it connects violence directed against individual black bodies, cyberwarfare in the form of targeted disinformation, the many costs of war, and escalation of nuclear risk.</h2>
                <p>Fighting for civil rights in the 1950s and 60s, black activists—including Bayard Ruskin, Malcolm X, Martin Luther and Coretta Scott King—adopted among their imperatives the battle against the largest existential threat: the nuclear arms race.</p>
                <p>During the Cold War, America’s failure to address its incessant and structural racism was a significant weakness in its pursuit to promote global democracy, and the Soviet Union capitalized on this discord by instrumentalizing American racism to weaken the U.S. both domestically and globally.</p>
                <p>As racial issues have persisted, so have the Russian government’s efforts to leverage them, undermining U.S. democracy most recently by inciting and amplifying racial animosities during the 2016 presidential election.</p>
                <p>Today, a new generation of black activists has stepped up to reenergize the movement for civil rights, continuing to advocate for all that remains unfulfilled and unreconciled. Yet African American leadership on questions of war—including nuclear weapons—has not emerged as prominently as before.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, U.S. nuclear legacy continues to disproportionately harm frontline communities, and the safety of entire populations teeters on the edge of hair trigger alerts and the imperfect judgment of the few in positions of geopolitical leadership; fifty years after the civil rights era, we’re facing similar and urgent issues of basic human rights and equity.</p>
                <p>Considering their historically reinforced position to take up moral leadership on questions of violence and power, the African American community plays a central role in fighting against a wasteful and dangerous new arms race.</p>
            </article>
            <article class="article_2">
                <h1 class="article_title">Spectrum of Threat & Militarization</h1>
                <h2 class="article_subtitle">African Americans have suffered violence and militarism throughout U.S. history, from the level of the individual body up to the highest tier of global geopolitical conflict. From this, African-Americans have developed a powerful moral claim to not only understanding the insidious impact of violence and fear, but to leadership in moving America away from militarism toward better approaches.</h2>
                <h3 class="section_heading">World:</h3>
                <p>Nuclear weapons are the ultimate manifestation of militarism, designed with a sole purpose: to kill as many civilians as possible. During the Cold War, at the height of the nuclear arms race, the Soviet Union used American’s failure to address its race challenges both <span class="media_trigger" data-media-index="0">to foment unrest in the U.S. and pull countries into its orbit</span>. Civil rights leaders like <span class="media_trigger" data-media-index="1">Bayard Rustin</span>, Malcolm X and Martin Luther King challenged U.S. foreign policy, including its reliance on nuclear weapons, as immoral and counterproductive. Civil rights leaders identified three interrelated things they were fighting against: racism, poverty and war. African-American leaders today share that moral leadership.</p>
                <h3 class="section_heading">Nation:</h3>
                <p>Many consider slavery American’s original sin. U.S. history has been shaped by efforts to make the claim in the Constitution, that “all men are created equal,” true. Yet progress has not been linear, nor rapid.  Emancipation and the Civil War led to the brief optimism of Reconstruction, followed by Jim Crow laws, pervasive discrimination, and lynchings. Progress again with the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts in the 1960s has been followed by mass incarceration and ongoing racist attacks against African Americans. The rise of Black Lives Matters and other groups to challenge ongoing violence against African Americans is the latest effort to continue this fight for progress.</p>
                <h3 class="section_heading">State:</h3>
                <p>State’s largely control two interrelated systems of critical importance to African-American communities, education and criminal justice. But priorities are backward. <span class="media_trigger">Spending on prisons and jails has increased at triple the rate of spending on Pre‐K‐12 public education in the last thirty years</span>. Through policy, states also significantly influence other issues that disproportionately impact African Americans, perhaps most significantly voter registration and voting rights. Since the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act in 2013, <span class="media_trigger">14 states have put new restrictive voting laws in place</span> making it harder for African-Americans to vote</p>
                <h3 class="section_heading">City:</h3>
                <p>Most citizens’ interactions with government occur at the city level. For too many African Americans, this interaction is primarily through law enforcement. The police aren’t seen as keepers of the peace, but levers in a system that disproportionately targets African Americans. African Americans are arrested <span class="media_trigger">at much higher rates</span> than other groups. In most cities, resources dedicated to education depend on local property tax resources, creating a vicious circle for low income African-American communities whose main exit from poverty is better education for their kids.</p>
                <h3 class="section_heading">Community:</h3>
                <p>Healthy communities depend on healthy families and active citizens.  Centuries of active attacks on African-American have led to the growth of strong communities who support their members in the challenges they face. This, too, creates backlash. Attacks like the 2015 shooting that killed nine parishioners at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church recognize the strength of this supportive community, and seek to undo it.  African-American and indigenoius communities have often borne the brunt of the negative impacts of the U.S. nuclear program complex.  <span class="media_trigger">When the Savannah River Nuclear complex was created in the 1950, 300 square miles of property was seized via eminent domain, dislocating many primarily African-American farmers and sharecroppers</span>.</p>
                <h3 class="section_heading">Family:</h3>
                <p>Systemic discrimination and violence against African-Americans has created unique challenges to family cohesion for 400 years.  Slavery, <span class="media_trigger">Jim Crow laws putting up barriers to employment and livelihoods, discriminatory access to finance, housing and health care</span>, and, today, mass incarceration, all have placed incredible burdens on establishing and maintaining families. <span class="media_trigger">In 2017, 65 percent of African-American children were in single-parent families, well above the national average of 34 percent</span>.</p>
                <h3 class="section_heading">Body:</h3>
                <p>From the beginning of colonization of America, violence against black bodies has been a constant:  from the <span class="media_trigger">arrival in Jamestown in 1619 of 20 Africans taken from Angola</span> to the widespread institution of slavery in revolutionary America to lynching and institutional violence in post-cival War Jim Crow America to ongoing police shootings and mass incarceration, individual African-Americans have faced unparalleled physical and psychological violence. In the nuclear sphere, the health of people of color has often been disproportionately impacted by nuclear weapons testing and production, including via radiation exposure of native Americans around New Mexico’s testing grounds and <span class="media_trigger">African-American workers in places like the Savannah River Site</span>.</p>

                <h1 class="article_title">The New Cold War: African Americans, Disinformation, and the Rise of Militarism</h1>
                <h2 class="article_subtitle">The US and Russia have been locked in a war since the 1940’s. A battle originally rooted in competing ideologies of democracy and communism has evolved into a no-holds-barred war for global power. African Americans, because of their voting strength, have long been targeted by—and retaliating powerfully against—both U.S. and Russian propaganda campaigns. The timeline below walks through the history of these dynamic disinformation campaigns and the consequent rise of key African American leaders against militarism and the arms race.</h2>

                <p class="quote">&ndash;Langston Hughes, Beaumont to Detroit: 1943</p>
                <p>Coming out of WWII, America faced two key challenges – containing the growing influence of the communist Soviet Union and managing the rising movement domestically for racial justice and civil rights. During the war, the <span class="media_trigger">‘Double V” campaign became a rallying cry</span> for black journalists, activists and citizens who wanted to secure victory both over Nazism during WWII and racism at home.</p>
                <p>Coming out of WWII, America and the Soviet Union went from allies to competitors on the world stage, working to increase their global influence by furthering democracy and communism, respectively. The US realized the inherent contradiction in their promotion of freedom and democracy globally, and subjugation of African Americans at home through the Jim Crow system. In an effort to control the global narrative, the United States weaponized the State Department - working to silence black entertainers and intellectuals who shared the realities of their experience internationally.  <span class="media_trigger">Paul Robeson</span> and Josephine Baker were notable black entertainers who were targeted by the State Department during that time, for suspicion of being communist.</p>
                <p>Although they fought alongside each other as allies during WWII, the relationship between the Soviet Union and the United States had long been strained. Americans were suspicious of Soviet communism and Joseph Stalin. The Soviets resented the US for their refusal to treat the USSR as a legitimate player on the international stage. This animosity evolved into an extended period of competition and hostility. The US focused on containing Soviet communist influence, and relied heavily on military force to achieve this aim. In 1950, the Truman administration recommended a 4-fold increase in defense spending and the pursuit of nuclear weapons to help cement their position as the premier superpower. However, the Soviets proved not far behind on their development of nuclear weapons. Successful espionage against the US program allowed the Soviets to detonate their own nuclear weapon, four years after the first US bomb.</p>
                <h3 class="section_heading">1960s &ndash; 1970s:<br>Mid Cold War</h3>
                <p>The 1950’s and 1960’s saw the coordinated, organized push in the court system and the streets for civil rights and full citizenship by African Americans. Judicial wins during this period included Brown vs. The Board of Education of 1954, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that prevented racial and religious discrimination in employment, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that prevented literacy tests as a prerequsite for voting, and the Civil Right Act of 1968 that prevented racial and religious discimination in housing.</p>
                <p>The Civil Rights Movement became the target for governmental meddling, both domestically and on the world stage. Domestically, FBI programs like COINTELPRO were designed to surveil, infiltrate, discredit and disrupt black liberation and civil rights organizations. Internationally, the Soviet Union and the U.S. were still embroiled in a battle of messaging, working to further their democratic and communist influence in developing countries. During the Civil Right Era, the Soviet Union exploited the realities of US racial animus to highlight the hypocrisy of the American narrative about being the defenders of ‘freedom and justice for all’. <span class="media_trigger">This propaganda campaign, initially launched as far back as the 1920s to support the global communist revolution, aimed to recruit black people to the Soviet cause by amplifying and exploiting African American racial grievances with the US government and citizenry.</span> The Little Rock Nine crisis became a Cold War hotspot, with Soviet newspapers running stories “derid[ing] Arkansans as “spiritual brothers of the Ku Klux Klan,” and all Americans for their attempt to mentor the world about higher moral absolutes. <span class="media_trigger">American democracy was only a façade, Soviet journalists argued.</span>”</p>
                <p class="quote">"We were taking the black young men who had been crippled by our society and sending them eight thousand miles away to guarantee liberties in Southeast Asia which they had not found in southwest Georgia and East Harlem."</p>
                <p class="quote">&ndash;MLK, Beyond Vietnam Speech</p>
                <p>A number a close calls between the US and the Soviet Union in the 1960’s - including the U2 incident, Berlin Airlift, and Cuban Missile Crisis - caused both countries to seek ways to reduce tensions and the risk of nuclear war. International outcry against the effects of nuclear weapons resulted in the negotiation of the Limited Test Ban Treaty and, subsequently, the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. However, outside of the newfound nuclear cooperation of this era, the Cold War continued. Proxy wars raged, most notably the Vietnam War. This long and costly war divided Americans bitterly, particularly in the later years when the US was spending over $25B on the effort. <span class="media_trigger">Although starting as a fringe movement, the anti-Vietnam war movement received a large boost when, in 1967, civil rights activist Dr. Martin Luther King Jr opposed the war on moral grounds, condemning the war’s diversion of funds away from social programs and disproportionate loss of life by African Americans serving in the war effort</span>.</p>
                <h3 class="section_heading">1980s &ndash; 1990s:<br>End of the Cold War</h3>
                <p>Activism continued through a period of cooling tensions between the superpowers known as detente.  At the same time, the nuclear establishment felt as if it was above the fray, since most of the protests centered on militarism at the close of the Vietnam War. But one strand emerged that remains powerful: the notion of a trade-off between spending on offensive weapons on the one hand and spending money to ease the burdens of the poor, the disenfranchised and the underrepresented.</p>
                <p>In 1968, residents of Brooklyn, in New York’s 12th district, choose as their member of Congress a community activist and state legislature named Shirley Chisolm, whose political slogan, memorably, was “unbought and unbossed.” Chisolm would become a leading voice in favor of rapid nuclear disarmament. Her 1974 run for president, while covered as a novelty, helped ensure that anti-militarism remained a subject for Democrats to debate in public.  It prefigured Rev. Jesse Jackson’s presidential run by 12 years.</p>
                <p><span class="media_trigger">In her first speech to Congress, Chisolm explicitly linked the causes of civil rights and anti-militarism, saying she would not vote to send a single penny to the Department of Defense until the country got its priorities straight.</span></p>
                <p>It was a message that took direct action—and many years of hard work—to circulate.</p>
                <p>In 1977, it emerged that President Jimmy Carter’s administration had agreed to spend millions of dollars on a new type of nuclear warhead, one that could (or so its creators insisted, without much evidence) destroy targets without leaving damaging fallout, and to place some of those warheads into Europe.</p>
                <p>A series of articles by Walter Pincus had two effects: it helped grow an already emboldened European peace movement, and it led to significant protests in the United States.  Framed by the journalist as a choice to spend money on “guns” over “butter,” the protests, in Washington, D.C, and in New York, organized and led by black political activists, brought into vivid focus wide education, health and infrastructure disparities between black and white people, and made national Democrats nervous about losing political support among black voters.</p>
                <p><span class="media_trigger">Within his own administration, Andrew Young, Carter’s ambassador to the United Nations, and a civil rights activist, voiced significant dissent</span>. In Europe, hard-line political leaders urged Carter to keep funding for the bomb, while grassroots peace protesters coalesced in opposition to it.  <span class="media_trigger">After dithering for 10 months, Carter decided to call off funding for the neutron bomb. The protests had worked</span>.</p>
                <p>Tensions inside the NATO alliance were high after the Soviet Union decided to station new missiles in Warsaw Pact countries capable of hitting European capitals. A growing peace movement staged massive protests as NATO decided how (or whether) to respond, often encircling basis in Europe where the United States controlled its nuclear weapons.  In Britain, and then in the United States, organizers used modern political techniques to build coherent political movements.</p>
                <p>In the late 1970s, anti-nuclear researcher Randall Fosberg noticed a surge of energy among activist groups and also how ineffective and disorganised most of them were. They could be harnessed in pursuit of a larger cause. She helped identity a nuclear freeze and military non-intervention as goals around which these groups could exchange ideas, membership lists, talking points, and activists, and by 1980, had created what amounted to the first, significant -- and politically powerful -- anti-nuclear movement in the United States.  Once again, civil rights group often led the way in organizing peace marches  in support of the freeze concept.</p>
                <p>By 1982, the movement had a presence in majority of Congressional districts in the country, and a referendum on a nuclear freeze became the main political forcing function of the midterm elections. <span class="media_trigger">Democrats flipped Republican seats in party by campaigning against nuclear weapons, for the first time ever, and the party grabbed control of the House of Representatives from the U.S. government</span>.</p>
                <p>This period saw ah an upsurge in nuclear activism in Europe, where the NATO coalition experienced severe strain because of internal political pressure: residents of European countries were acutely aware that World War III would begin and end on their continent.  <span class="media_trigger">Protests by millions in Europe, with support by similar protests in the US</span>, were a significant contributor to the signing and ratification of the Intermediate Nuclear Forces treaty in 1988.  A million people converged in Central Park in 1982 to protest against nuclear weapons, the largest peace protest ever. <span class="media_trigger">Coretta Scott King was one of the speakers at this Central Park peace rally</span>, highlighting the importance of people power in changing policy.  <span class="media_trigger">The Southern Christian Leadership Conference helped organize the Central Park rally, while representatives of the Black Congressional Caucus and black labor groups used the event, while backing a nuclear freeze, to highlight the Reagan government’s economic policies as an even more pressing concern for African Americans</span>:  “Peace and disarmament are important to blacks but economics in general are much more pressing," said William Lucy, president of the Black Trade Unionists, who endorsed the freeze.”</p>
                <p>Russia, eager to exploit internal tensions inside Europe and the United States, covertly funded radical anti-nuclear movements in Europe, to some effect. Its effort inside the United States were more limited, and although the Reagan administration claimed that the Soviets were aiding the protests, the U.S intelligence community found that, while agendas may have overlapped and propaganda was promulgated by Russians, the movement was largely organic. <span class="media_trigger">The Russians largely tried and failed to influence U.S. policy</span>.</p>
                <h3 class="section_heading">2010 &ndash; Present:<br>The New Cold War</h3>
                <p>The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the dissolution of the Soviet Union led many to conclude that nuclear rivalry was over. Several of the new former Soviet States that had nuclear weapons gave them up, leaving only Russia with nuclear weapons. Russia honored the nuclear commitments of the former Soviet Union under treaties like the Intermediate Nuclear Forces agreement, and the U.S. and Russia signed a new treaty, START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty), in 1991, committing to continue to reduce the number of nuclear weapons and delivery vehicles each maintained. The perception that the U.S. had “won” the Cold War, the expansion of NATO to former Eastern European and Soviet countries, and Russian economic weakness, all contributed to a reduction in focus on the U.S.-Russia rivalry and a shift away from concerns about nuclear weapons.</p>
                <p>Barack Obama re-focused attention on nuclear weapons. Early in his administration, President Obama made a strong argument for continued reduction in nuclear risks. He pushed for and was able to get signed and ratified a <span class="media_trigger">new START treaty</span> further limiting U.S. and Russian nuclear weapons and inaugurated a series of <span class="media_trigger">Nuclear Security Summits</span> to better control proliferation risks around radioactive materials.  On the Russia side, however, President Putin, though willing to engage on nuclear risk reduction, had been pushing an increasingly activist nationalist Russian message, seeking to restore Russia’s role on the world stage and criticizing U.S. unilateral actions, including on Iraq, its support for opposition forces in Russia, and its positions regarding potential NATO expansion to Ukraine and Georgia.  Russia’s seizure of Crimea in 2014 and its invasion of Eastern Ukraine brought these tensions to a new level, with the U.S. and NATO refusing to recognize Russian claims of sovereignty over Crimea and deploying sanctions against Russia.</p>
                <p>Unrecognized at the time, 2014 also saw the launch of more active efforts by Russia to destabilize the U.S. political system.  <span class="media_trigger">A report</span> commissioned by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence provides in great detail the breadth and depth of Russian efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election. Returning to a time-tested tactic, Russia aimed a significant portion of its efforts at inciting racial animus.  <span class="media_trigger">Subsequent analysis of the Russia effort concluded</span>, “<span class="quote">One of (the) goals is to “sow division,” to put pressure on the fault lines in our society. A divided society that turns against itself, that cannot come together and find common ground, is one that is easily manipulated….Russian agents did not create political division in the United States, but they were working to encourage it.</span>”   The analysis continued, “<span class="quote">Their second goal is to shape these communities toward their other strategic aims....Not surprisingly, considering what we now know about their 2016 strategy, the IRA accounts on the right ...converged in support of Donald Trump. When we look specifically at the IRA accounts on the left, they were consistently critical of Hillary Clinton, highlighting previous statements of hers they perceived to be racist and encouraging otherwise left-leaning people not to vote for her. Therefore, we can see the IRA accounts using two different strategies... but with the same goal (of electing Donald Trump).</span>”</p>
                <p>While President Trump has indicated a desire to improve relations with Russia, the intervention of Russia in the U.S. election, combined with ongoing efforts of Russia to improve its geopolitical and military standing, have put us on a path to a new Cold War.  On August 2, 2019, the <span class="media_trigger">Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty</span> was abandoned, as the U.S. pulled out following what it claims was years of Russian non-compliance.  Russia has announced plans to create new types of strategic weapons (including a nuclear submarine missile), while President Trump has also elevated the role of nuclear weapons in his approach (most visibly in the <span class="media_trigger">Nuclear Posture Review</span> published in 2018).  The New START Treaty, the last arms control treaty in effect between the U.S. and Russia, expires in 2021, and <span class="media_trigger">the Trump administration is downplaying the likelihood of its renewal</span>, which would leave us, for the first time in decades, with no ability to inspect or verify Russia nuclear weapons activities.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, in testimony before Congress in July 2019, Special Counsel Robert Mueller reaffirmed the breadth and depth of Russian interference in the U.S. presidential elections.  More importantly, in response to a question about whether the risk of future interference remained, he replied, “It wasn’t a single attempt. They’re doing as we sit here.  And they expect to do it during the next campaign.”</p>
                <h3 class="section_heading">Conclusion</h3>
                <p>For over 70 years, Russia has used the U.S. failure to address its racial divisions as a way to tarnish the U.S. model, undermine U.S. global alliances, and, most recently, undermine and destabilize U.S. democracy.  The tactics have changed - and, with social media, have become even more nuanced, and therefore more difficult to detect and, in many ways, more insidious than ever before.  The breadth and depth of the Russian attack on democracy over the last few years has been unprecedented.  But our knowledge about what they are doing, and how they are doing it, is increasing.  Long leaders in connecting civil rights, democracy and peace, African Americans are uniquely positioned to fight back against efforts to both disenfranchise them and make them unwitting accomplices to attacks on U.S. democracy.</p>
                <p>Bayard Ruskin, Martin Luther King, Macolm X, Barack Obama, and the black leaders of today, via the Movement for Black Lives  or political leaders like John Lewis, Elijah Cummigs, Will Hurd, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and more - all have been working on the American challenge, present from day the country’s birth, of making the union a more perfect one.  Fighting back against a new Cold War, attacks on democracy, and efforts to divide us based on race -  this is a fight African American leaders know how to fight and win.</p>
