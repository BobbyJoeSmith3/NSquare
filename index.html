                <p>Many consider slavery American’s original sin. U.S. history has been shaped by efforts to make the claim in the Constitution, that “all men are created equal,” true. Yet progress has not been linear, nor rapid.  Emancipation and the Civil War led to the brief optimism of Reconstruction, followed by Jim Crow laws, pervasive discrimination, and lynchings. Progress again with the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts in the 1960s has been followed by mass incarceration and ongoing racist attacks against African Americans.

A battle originally rooted in competing ideologies of democracy and communism has evolved into a no-holds-barred war for global power.

During the war, the “Double V” campaign became a rallying cry for black journalists, activists and citizens who wanted to secure victory over both Nazism during WWII and racism at home.</p>

                <p class="quote">&ndash;Langston Hughes, Beaumont to Detroit: 1943</p>
                <p>After the war, the U.S. and the Soviet Union went from allies to competitors on the world stage, working to increase their global influence by furthering democracy and communism, respectively. America realized the inherent contradiction in their promotion of global democracy while African Americans at home remained subject to the Jim Crow system. In an effort to control the global narrative, the United States weaponized the State Department, working to silence black entertainers and intellectuals who shared the realities of their experience internationally. During that time, Paul Robeson and Josephine Baker were notable black entertainers who were targeted by the State Department for suspicion of being communist.</p>
                <p>Despite their wartime allyship, the relationship between the U.S. and Soviet Union had long been strained. Americans were suspicious of Soviet communism and Joseph Stalin. The Soviets resented the U.S. for their refusal to treat the U.S.S.R. as a legitimate player on the international stage. This animosity evolved into an extended period of competition and hostility. The U.S. focused on containing Soviet communist influence, relying heavily on military force to do so. In 1950, the Truman administration recommended a fourfold increase in defense spending and the pursuit of nuclear weapons to help cement their position as the premier superpower. However, the Soviets proved not far behind on their development of nuclear weapons. Successful espionage against the U.S. program allowed the Soviets to detonate their own nuclear weapon, four years after the first US bomb.</p>
                <h3 class="section_heading">1960s &ndash; 1970s:<br>Mid Cold War</h3>
                <p>The 1950s and 1960s saw the coordinated, organized push in the court system and the streets for civil rights and full citizenship by African Americans. Judicial wins during this period included Brown vs. The Board of Education of 1954, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that prevented racial and religious discrimination in employment, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that prevented literacy tests as a prerequsite for voting, and the Civil Right Act of 1968 that prevented racial and religious discimination in housing.</p>
                <p>At the same time, the Civil Rights Movement became a target for governmental meddling, both domestically and on the world stage. Within the country, FBI programs like COINTELPRO were designed to surveil, infiltrate, discredit, and disrupt black liberation and civil rights organizations. Internationally, the Soviet Union and the U.S. were still embroiled in a battle of messaging, working to further their democratic and communist influence in developing countries. During the Civil Right Era, the Soviet Union exploited the realities of US racial animus to highlight the hypocrisy of the American narrative about being the defenders of ‘freedom and justice for all’. This propaganda campaign, initially launched as far back as the 1920s to support the global communist revolution, aimed to recruit black people to the Soviet cause by amplifying and exploiting African American racial grievances with the US government and citizenry. The Little Rock Nine crisis became a Cold War hotspot, with Soviet newspapers running stories “derid[ing] Arkansans as ‘spiritual brothers of the Ku Klux Klan,’ and all Americans for their attempt to mentor the world about higher moral absolutes. American democracy was only a façade, Soviet journalists argued.”</p>
                <p class="quote">"We were taking the black young men who had been crippled by our society and sending them eight thousand miles away to guarantee liberties in Southeast Asia which they had not found in southwest Georgia and East Harlem."</p>
                <p class="quote">&ndash;MLK, Beyond Vietnam Speech</p>
                <p>A number of close calls between the U.S. and the Soviet Union in the 1960s—including the U2 incident, Berlin Airlift, and Cuban Missile Crisis—led both countries to seek ways to reduce tensions and the risk of nuclear war. International outcry against the effects of nuclear weapons resulted in the negotiation of the Limited Test Ban Treaty and, subsequently, the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.</p>
                <p>However, outside of the newfound nuclear cooperation of this era, the Cold War continued. Proxy wars raged, most notably the Vietnam War. This long and costly war divided Americans bitterly, particularly in the later years when the US was spending over $25B on the effort. Although starting as a fringe movement, the anti-Vietnam war movement received a large boost when, in 1967, civil rights activist Dr. Martin Luther King Jr opposed the war on moral grounds, condemning the war’s diversion of funds away from social programs and disproportionate loss of life by African Americans serving in the war effort.</p>
                <h3 class="section_heading">1980s &ndash; 1990s:<br>End of the Cold War</h3>
                <p>Activism continued through a period of cooling tensions between the superpowers known as détente. At the same time, the nuclear establishment felt as if it were above the fray, since most of the protests centered on militarism at the close of the Vietnam War. But one strand emerged and remains powerful to this day: the trade-off between spending money on an arsenal of weapons and spending money to ease the burdens of the poor, the disenfranchised, and the underrepresented.</p>
                <p>In 1968, residents of Brooklyn choose as their member of Congress a community activist and state legislature named Shirley Chisolm, whose memorable political slogan was “unbought and unbossed.” Chisolm would become a leading voice in favor of rapid nuclear disarmament. Her 1974 run for president, while covered as a novelty, helped ensure that anti-militarism remained a subject for Democrats to debate in public. It prefigured Rev. Jesse Jackson’s presidential run by 12 years.</p>
                <p>In her first speech to Congress, Chisolm explicitly linked the causes of civil rights and anti-militarism, saying she would not vote to send a single penny to the Department of Defense until the country got its priorities straight. It was a message that took direct action—and many years of hard work—to circulate.</p>
                <p>In 1977, it emerged that President Jimmy Carter’s administration had agreed to spend millions of dollars on a new type of nuclear warhead, one that could (or so its creators insisted, without much evidence) destroy targets without leaving damaging fallout, and to place some of those warheads into Europe.</p>
                <p>A series of articles by national security journalist Walter Pincus had two effects: it helped grow an already emboldened European peace movement, and it led to significant protests in the United States. Framed as a choice to spend money on “guns” over “butter,” the protests—in D.C. and New York, organized and led by black political activists—brought into vivid focus the disparities between black and white Americans’ access to quality education, healthcare and infrastructure. National Democrats became increasingly nervous about losing political support among black voters.</p>
                <p>Within his own administration, Andrew Young—Carter’s ambassador to the United Nations and a civil rights activist—voiced significant dissent. In Europe, hard-line political leaders urged Carter to keep funding the bomb, while grassroots peace protesters coalesced in opposition to it. After dithering for 10 months, Carter decided to call off funding for the neutron bomb. The protests had worked.</p>
                <p>Tensions inside the NATO alliance were high after the Soviet Union decided to station new missiles in Warsaw Pact countries capable of hitting European capitals. A growing peace movement staged massive protests as NATO decided how (or whether) to respond, often encircling bases in Europe where the United States controlled its nuclear weapons. In Britain, and then in the United States, organizers used modern political techniques to build coherent political movements.</p>
                <p>In the late 1970s, anti-nuclear researcher Dr. Randall Caroline Forsberg noticed a surge of energy among activist groups and also how ineffective and disorganised most of them were. They could be harnessed in pursuit of a larger cause. She helped identity a nuclear freeze and military non-intervention as goals around which these groups could exchange ideas, membership lists, talking points, and activists. By 1980, Forsberg had created what amounted to the first politically powerful anti-nuclear movement in the United States. Once again, civil rights groups often led the way in organizing peace marches in support of the freeze concept.</p>
                <p>By 1982, the movement had a presence in majority of Congressional districts in the country, and a referendum on a nuclear freeze became the main political forcing function of the midterm elections. Democrats flipped Republican seats by campaigning against nuclear weapons—for the first time ever—and the party grabbed control of the House of Representatives from the U.S. government.</p>
                <p>This period saw an upsurge in nuclear activism in Europe, where the NATO coalition experienced severe strain because of internal political pressure: residents of European countries were acutely aware that World War III would begin and end on their continent.  Protests by millions in Europe, with support by similar protests in the US, were a significant contributor to the signing and ratification of the Intermediate Nuclear Forces treaty in 1988. A million people converged in Central Park in 1982 to protest against nuclear weapons, the largest peace protest ever. Coretta Scott King was one of the speakers at this Central Park peace rally, highlighting the importance of people-power in changing policy. The Southern Christian Leadership Conference helped organize the rally, while representatives of the Black Congressional Caucus and black labor groups used the event to also highlight the Reagan government’s economic policies as an even more pressing concern for African Americans:  “Peace and disarmament are important to blacks, but economics in general are much more pressing,” said William Lucy, president of the Black Trade Unionists, who endorsed the freeze.</p>
                <p>Russia, eager to exploit internal tensions inside Europe and the United States, covertly funded radical anti-nuclear movements in Europe. Its efforts inside the United States were more limited, and although the Reagan administration claimed they were aiding protests, the U.S. intelligence community found that—while agendas may have overlapped and propaganda was promulgated by Russians—the movement was largely organic. At the time, Russia tried and largely failed to influence U.S. policy.</p>
                <h3 class="section_heading">2010 &ndash; Present:<br>The New Cold War</h3>
                <p>The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the dissolution of the Soviet Union led many to conclude that nuclear rivalry was over. Several of the new former Soviet States that had nuclear weapons gave them up, leaving only Russia with nuclear weapons. Russia honored the nuclear commitments of the former Soviet Union under treaties like the Intermediate Nuclear Forces agreement. In 1991, the U.S. and Russia signed a new treaty, START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty), committing to continued reduction of nuclear weapons and their delivery vehicles. The perception that the U.S. had “won” the Cold War, the expansion of NATO to former Eastern European and Soviet countries, and Russian economic weakness, all lessened the focus on U.S.-Russia rivalry and concerns about nuclear weapons.</p>
                <p>President Barack Obama refocused the nation’s attention on nuclear weapons early in his administration, when he made a strong argument for continued reduction in nuclear risks. He pushed for the signing and ratification of a New START Treaty, further limiting U.S. and Russian nuclear weapons, and inaugurated a series of Nuclear Security Summits to better control proliferation risks around radioactive materials. But Russia’s President Putin, though willing to engage on nuclear risk reduction, had been pushing an increasingly nationalist Russian message. In seeking to restore Russia’s role on the world stage, he criticized U.S. unilateral actions, its support for opposition forces in Russia, and its positions regarding potential NATO expansion to Ukraine and Georgia. Russia’s seizure of Crimea in 2014 and its invasion of Eastern Ukraine brought these tensions to a new level, with the U.S. and NATO refusing to recognize Russian claims of sovereignty over Crimea and deploying sanctions against Russia.</p>
                <p>Unrecognized at the time, 2014 also saw the launch of more active efforts by Russia to destabilize the U.S. political system. A report commissioned by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence provides in great detail the breadth and depth of Russian efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election. Returning to a time-tested tactic, Russia aimed a significant portion of its efforts at inciting racial animus. Subsequent analysis of the Russia effort concluded:</p>
                <p class="quote">“One of (the) goals is to ‘sow division,’ to put pressure on the fault lines in our society. A divided society that turns against itself, that cannot come together and find common ground, is one that is easily manipulated…Russian agents did not create political division in the United States, but they were working to encourage it…Their second goal is to shape these communities toward their other strategic aims...Not surprisingly, considering what we now know about their 2016 strategy, the IRA accounts on the right ...converged in support of Donald Trump. When we look specifically at the IRA accounts on the left, they were consistently critical of Hillary Clinton, highlighting previous statements of hers they perceived to be racist and encouraging otherwise left-leaning people not to vote for her. Therefore, we can see the IRA accounts using two different strategies... but with the same goal (of electing Donald Trump).”</p>
                <p>While President Trump has indicated a desire to improve relations with Russia, the intervention of Russia in the U.S. election, combined with ongoing efforts of Russia to improve its geopolitical and military standing, have put us on a path to a new Cold War. On August 2, 2019, the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty was abandoned, as the U.S. pulled out following what it claims was years of Russian non-compliance. Russia has announced plans to create new types of nuclear weapons including a nuclear submarine missile, while President Trump has also elevated the role of nuclear weapons in his approach—most visibly in the Nuclear Posture Review published in 2018. The New START Treaty, the last arms control treaty in effect between the U.S. and Russia, expires in 2021 and the Trump administration is downplaying the likelihood of its renewal. That would leave us, for the first time in decades, with no ability to inspect or verify Russia nuclear weapons activities.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, in testimony before Congress in July 2019, Special Counsel Robert Mueller reaffirmed the breadth and depth of Russian interference in the U.S. presidential elections. In response to a question about whether the risk of future interference remained, he replied: “It wasn’t a single attempt. They’re doing as we sit here. And they expect to do it during the next campaign.”</p>
                <h3 class="section_heading">Conclusion</h3>
                <p>For over 70 years, Russia has used the U.S. failure to address its racial divisions as a way to tarnish the U.S. model, undermine U.S. global alliances, and most recently to undermine and destabilize U.S. democracy. Disinformation tactics have changed along with the rise of social media; they’ve become even more nuanced and difficult to detect. However they continue to leverage racial discord as their primary approach, specifically targeting African Americans and communities of color in their influence campaigns. The breadth and depth of the Russian attack on democracy over the last few years has been unprecedented—but our knowledge about what they’re doing, and how they are doing it, is increasing. Longtime leaders in connecting civil rights, democracy, and peace, African Americans are uniquely positioned to fight back against efforts to disenfranchise them at the expense of U.S. democracy.</p>
                <p>Bayard Ruskin, Martin Luther King, Macolm X, Barack Obama—along with the black leaders of today via the Movement for Black Lives and figures like John Lewis, Elijah Cummigs, Will Hurd, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and more—have all been working on the ever present American challenge of making the union a more perfect one.</p>
                <p>Fighting back against a new Cold War, attacks on democracy, and efforts to divide us based on race—this is a fight African American leaders know how to fight and win.</p>

                <p>Did you know that  African Americans have been at the forefront of the fight against nuclear weapons?</p>
                <p>In 1945, after American pilots destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki, killing tens of thousands of Japanese citizens in an instant, the poet Langston Hughes wrote that only ingrained racism could make a President so blind to the willful destruction of so many people of an entire race.</p>
                <p>Zora Neale Hurston called President Harry Truman “The BUTCHER OF ASIA.”</p>
                <p>20 years later, Malcom X, breaking bread with Japanese-American activists in Harlem, saw that they had been “scarred by the atom bomb. You just saw that we have also been scarred. The bomb that hit us was racism.”</p>
                <p>Three years later, a year before he was assassinated,  Martin Luther King told Nobel laureates that he “refused to accept the cynical notion that nation after nation must spiral down a militaristic stairway into the hell of thermonuclear destruction.”</p>
                <p>These protests were not in vain. In 1977, when it was reported that President Jimmy Carter had authorized research into the so-called “neutron bomb,”  thousands of African American women and men took to the streets in Washington, protesting the decision to divert health and human beings and towards weapons of war.  The protests were one of the reasons why that research was stopped.</p>
                <p>In 1982, Barack Obama, then at Columbia University in New York, was among the hundreds of thousands of activists who protested President Reagan’s military build-up, which included billions to “modernize” the nuclear arsenal.  Democrats won control of the House that fall, and Reagan’s ambitions were checked, at least for a while.</p>
                <p>Today, the United States plans to spend hundreds of billions of dollars over the next 10 years … again, to modernize the nuclear arsenal. But just half of that money… could ensure that every black mother in America has access to top-notch maternity care for decades to come… it could fund educational programs that teach young men and women about global citizenship… a fraction of that money could ensure that everyone, everywhere, can exercise their right to vote freely and securely.</p>
                <p>Your voice counts. Make sure that presidential candidates hear it.</p>

                <p>In order to get the result they wanted from the 2016 election, the Russian government turned an old trick. They picked at the scars of America’s original sin—racial animus—setting Americans against one another, but with a clear and ugly undertone: they tried to get black Americans not to vote.</p>
                <p>The Russians knew they could influence American opinion by suppressing the black vote, because it worked to their advantage before. During the Cold War, the Russian line was that America was hypocritical; it could not spread the cause of freedom around the world while it brutally subjugated the rights of its own people. Russians didn’t really care about racial harmony and progress. Their main goal was chaos—to split people into groups.</p>
                <p>Russia tried to tell black people how to vote then—and they’re doing it again now.</p>
                <p>Their interests found common cause with a growing movement to disenfranchise black voters in states where candidates of color can win elections.</p>
                <p>Candidates who support social justice don’t get a fair shake when you don’t vote.</p>
                <p>Candidates who support militarism, who threaten to nuke other countries into oblivion, who pull money away from health care, maternity coverage, and education, and use it instead on new bombers and new missiles.</p>

                <h1 class="article_title">Where We Are Today: President Obama and Nuclear Weapons</h1>
                <h3 class="section_heading">(Transcript)</h3>
                <p>President Obama made reducing the nuclear risk a key element of his presidency. He had some important successes, including the New START Treaty with Russia, the Iran nuclear deal and the Nuclear Security Summit process to secure the materials that go into nuclear weapons. He also left office with several nuclear challenges outstanding, including plans to modernize the U.S. nuclear infrastructure, North Korean nuclear threats, and tensions with Russia. Like other African American leaders before him, Obama drew a clear connection between civil rights and the fight against war and nuclear weapons.</p>
                <p class="quote">“I make this statement mindful of what Martin Luther King Jr. said in this same ceremony years ago: “Violence never brings permanent peace. It solves no social problem: it merely creates new and more complicated ones.” As someone who stands here as a direct consequence of Dr. King’s life work, I am living testimony to the moral force of non-violence. I know there’s nothing weak—nothing passive, nothing naïve—in the creed and lives of Gandhi and King.</p>
                <p class="quote">But we do not have to think that human nature is perfect for us to still believe that the human condition can be perfected. We do not have to live in an idealized world to still reach for those ideals that will make it a better place. The non-violence practiced by men like Gandhi and King may not have been practical or possible in every circumstance, but the love that they preached—their fundamental faith in human progress—that must always be the North Star that guides us on our journey.</p>
                <p class="quote">We can acknowledge that oppression will always be with us, and still strive for justice. We can admit the intractability of deprivation, and still strive for dignity. Clear-eyed, we can understand that there will be war, and still strive for peace. We can do that—for that is the story of human progress; that’s the hope of all the world; and at this moment of challenge, that must be our work here on Earth.”</p>
                <p>Obama teed up his commitment to a world free of nuclear weapons early in his Administration with a speech in Prague in the spring of 2009 where he again drew the through-line:</p>
                <p class="quote">“The existence of thousands of nuclear weapons is the most dangerous legacy of the Cold War. No nuclear war was fought between the United States and the Soviet Union, but generations lived with the knowledge that their world could be erased in a single flash of light. Cities like Prague that existed for centuries, that embodied the beauty and the talent of so much of humanity, would have ceased to exist.</p>
                <p class="quote">Today, the Cold War has disappeared but thousands of those weapons have not. In a strange turn of history, the threat of global nuclear war has gone down, but the risk of a nuclear attack has gone up.</p>
                <p class="quote">Now, understand, this matters to people everywhere. One nuclear weapon exploded in one city—be it New York or Moscow, Islamabad or Mumbai, Tokyo or Tel Aviv, Paris or Prague—could kill hundreds of thousands of people. And no matter where it happens, there is no end to what the consequences might be—for our global safety, our security, our society, our economy, to our ultimate survival.</p>
                <p class="quote">Just as we stood for freedom in the 20th century, we must stand together for the right of people everywhere to live free from fear in the 21st century. And as the only nuclear power to have used a nuclear weapon, the United States has a moral responsibility to act.</p>
                <p class="quote">So today, I state clearly and with conviction America's commitment to seek the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons. I'm not naive. This goal will not be reached quickly—perhaps not in my lifetime. It will take patience and persistence. But now we, too, must ignore the voices who tell us that the world cannot change. We have to insist, ‘Yes, we can.’</p>
                <p class="quote">When nations and peoples allow themselves to be defined by their differences, the gulf between them widens. When we fail to pursue peace, then it stays forever beyond our grasp. We know the path when we choose fear over hope. To denounce or shrug off a call for cooperation is an easy but also a cowardly thing to do. That's how wars begin. That's where human progress ends.”</p>
                <p>Toward the end of his presidency in May 2016, Obama visited Hiroshima—the site of the first atomic bomb detonated in World War II. There, he continued to argue for the elimination of nuclear weapons.</p>
                <p class="quote">“Yet in the image of a mushroom cloud that rose into these skies, we are most starkly reminded of humanity’s core contradiction. How the very spark that marks us as a species, our thoughts, our imagination, our language, our toolmaking, our ability to set ourselves apart from nature and bend it to our will—those very things also give us the capacity for unmatched destruction.</p>
                <p class="quote">How often does material advancement or social innovation blind us to this truth. How easily we learn to justify violence in the name of some higher cause. Every great religion promises a pathway to love and peace and righteousness, and yet no religion has been spared from believers who have claimed their faith as a license to kill. Nations arise, telling a story that binds people together in sacrifice and cooperation, allowing for remarkable feats, but those same stories have so often been used to oppress and dehumanize those who are different.</p>
                <p class="quote">We may not be able to eliminate man’s capacity to do evil, so nations—and the alliances that we’ve formed—must possess the means to defend ourselves. But among those nations like my own that hold nuclear stockpiles, we must have the courage to escape the logic of fear, and pursue a world without them.</p>
                <p class="quote">We’re not bound by genetic code to repeat the mistakes of the past. We can learn. We can choose. We can tell our children a different story—one that describes a common humanity; one that makes war less likely and cruelty less easily accepted.</p>
                <p class="quote">“My own nation’s story began with simple words: All men are created equal, and endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights, including life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Realizing that ideal has never been easy, even within our own borders, even among our own citizens.”</p>
                <p class="quote">But staying true to that story is worth the effort. It is an ideal to be strived for; an ideal that extends across continents, and across oceans. The irreducible worth of every person, the insistence that every life is precious; the radical and necessary notion that we are part of a single human family—that is the story that we all must tell.”</p>
                <p>President Obama carried forward the leadership on nuclear disarmament that was born in the African American community at the dawn of the nuclear age. But as he himself acknowledged, the effort to rid the world of these incredibly dangerous weapons will continue. Look no further than the current Administration’s backtracking on the Iran nuclear deal and elevating the role of nuclear weapons again in U.S. strategic thinking. We’re on the road to a new nuclear arms race and a new Cold War. We need to build on the legacy of African American leadership in this arena to continue to push for peace.</p>

                <h1 class="article_title">Research Outcomes and Futures</h1>
                <p>This project grew out of the observation that while race, poverty, and anti-war elements were all part of the civil rights movement in the 1960s, today’s push for economic and social justice has not wholly embraced the fight for peace. In the face of an Administration that has talked up the value of nuclear weapons and threatened a new arms race, this silence is troubling.</p>
                <p>The initial research effort you see on these pages has simply been designed to draw a through-line between the civil rights and anti-militarization work of the 1960s to modern realities, as well as emphasize the connections between social justice and peace. We hope it serves as a starting point for deeper conversations about the connection between social justice, militarism and the importance of avoiding a new nuclear arms race. No one benefits from building weapons we cannot use, and there are significant opportunity costs of allocating federal resources this way.</p>
                <p>One of the key take-aways from this research was the difficulty in making the case to the African American community for a foreign policy focus in their activism in the face of overwhelming domestic challenges - from excessive force by the police, to voter suppression, to securing quality education for students of color. One path for further investigation is making the connections between these issues and nuclear weapons investment more salient - particularly on issues of economics and environmental justice.</p>
