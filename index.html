                <h1 class="article_title">Abstract</h1>
                <h2 class="article_subtitle">African Americans have long recognized the throughline of militarism in the United States and the nefarious ways it connects violence directed against individual black bodies, cyberwarfare in the form of targeted disinformation, the many costs of war, and escalation of nuclear risk.</h2>
                <p>Fighting for civil rights in the 1950s and 60s, black activists—including Bayard Ruskin, Malcolm X, Martin Luther and Coretta Scott King—adopted among their imperatives the battle against the largest existential threat: the nuclear arms race.</p>
                <p>During the Cold War, America’s failure to address its incessant and structural racism was a significant weakness in its pursuit to promote global democracy, and the Soviet Union capitalized on this discord by instrumentalizing American racism to weaken the U.S. both domestically and globally.</p>
                <p>As racial issues have persisted, so have the Russian government’s efforts to leverage them, undermining U.S. democracy most recently by inciting and amplifying racial animosities during the 2016 presidential election.</p>
                <p>Today, a new generation of black activists has stepped up to reenergize the movement for civil rights, continuing to advocate for all that remains unfulfilled and unreconciled. Yet African American leadership on questions of war—including nuclear weapons—has not emerged as prominently as before.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, U.S. nuclear legacy continues to disproportionately harm frontline communities, and the safety of entire populations teeters on the edge of hair trigger alerts and the imperfect judgment of the few in positions of geopolitical leadership; fifty years after the civil rights era, we’re facing similar and urgent issues of basic human rights and equity.</p>
                <p>Considering their historically reinforced position to take up moral leadership on questions of violence and power, the African American community plays a central role in fighting against a wasteful and dangerous new arms race.</p>

            <article class="article_2">
                <h1 class="article_title">Spectrum of Threat & Militarization</h1>
                <h2 class="article_subtitle">African Americans have suffered violence and militarism throughout U.S. history, from the level of the individual body up to the highest tier of global geopolitical conflict. From this, African-Americans have developed a powerful moral claim to not only understanding the insidious impact of violence and fear, but to leadership in moving America away from militarism toward better approaches.</h2>
                <h3 class="section_heading">World:</h3>
                <p>Nuclear weapons are the ultimate manifestation of militarism, designed with a sole purpose: to kill as many civilians as possible. During the Cold War, at the height of the nuclear arms race, the Soviet Union used American’s failure to address its race challenges both <span class="media_trigger">to foment unrest in the U.S. and pull countries into its orbit</span>. Civil rights leaders like Bayard Rustin, Malcolm X and Martin Luther King challenged U.S. foreign policy, including its reliance on nuclear weapons, as immoral and counterproductive. Civil rights leaders identified three interrelated things they were fighting against: racism, poverty and war. African-American leaders today share that moral leadership.</p>
                <h3 class="section_heading">Nation:</h3>
                <p>Many consider slavery American’s original sin. U.S. history has been shaped by efforts to make the claim in the Constitution, that “all men are created equal,” true. Yet progress has not been linear, nor rapid.  Emancipation and the Civil War led to the brief optimism of Reconstruction, followed by Jim Crow laws, pervasive discrimination, and lynchings. Progress again with the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts in the 1960s has been followed by mass incarceration and ongoing racist attacks against African Americans. The rise of Black Lives Matters and other groups to challenge ongoing violence against African Americans is the latest effort to continue this fight for progress.</p>
                <h3 class="section_heading">State:</h3>
                <p>State’s largely control two interrelated systems of critical importance to African-American communities, education and criminal justice. But priorities are backward. <span class="media_trigger">Spending on prisons and jails has increased at triple the rate of spending on Pre‐K‐12 public education in the last thirty years</span>. Through policy, states also significantly influence other issues that disproportionately impact African Americans, perhaps most significantly voter registration and voting rights. Since the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act in 2013, <span class="media_trigger">14 states have put new restrictive voting laws in place</span> making it harder for African-Americans to vote</p>
                <h3 class="section_heading">City:</h3>
                <p>Most citizens’ interactions with government occur at the city level. For too many African Americans, this interaction is primarily through law enforcement. The police aren’t seen as keepers of the peace, but levers in a system that disproportionately targets African Americans. African Americans are arrested <span class="media_trigger">at much higher rates</span> than other groups. In most cities, resources dedicated to education depend on local property tax resources, creating a vicious circle for low income African-American communities whose main exit from poverty is better education for their kids.</p>
                <h3 class="section_heading">Community:</h3>
                <p>Healthy communities depend on healthy families and active citizens.  Centuries of active attacks on African-American have led to the growth of strong communities who support their members in the challenges they face. This, too, creates backlash. Attacks like the 2015 shooting that killed nine parishioners at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church recognize the strength of this supportive community, and seek to undo it.  African-American and indigenoius communities have often borne the brunt of the negative impacts of the U.S. nuclear program complex.  <span class="media_trigger">When the Savannah River Nuclear complex was created in the 1950, 300 square miles of property was seized via eminent domain, dislocating many primarily African-American farmers and sharecroppers</span>.</p>
                <h3 class="section_heading">Family:</h3>
                <p>Systemic discrimination and violence against African-Americans has created unique challenges to family cohesion for 400 years.  Slavery, <span class="media_trigger">Jim Crow laws putting up barriers to employment and livelihoods, discriminatory access to finance, housing and health care</span>, and, today, mass incarceration, all have placed incredible burdens on establishing and maintaining families. <span class="media_trigger">In 2017, 65 percent of African-American children were in single-parent families, well above the national average of 34 percent</span>.</p>
                <h3 class="section_heading">Body:</h3>
                <p>From the beginning of colonization of America, violence against black bodies has been a constant:  from the <span class="media_trigger">arrival in Jamestown in 1619 of 20 Africans taken from Angola</span> to the widespread institution of slavery in revolutionary America to lynching and institutional violence in post-cival War Jim Crow America to ongoing police shootings and mass incarceration, individual African-Americans have faced unparalleled physical and psychological violence. In the nuclear sphere, the health of people of color has often been disproportionately impacted by nuclear weapons testing and production, including via radiation exposure of native Americans around New Mexico’s testing grounds and <span class="media_trigger">African-American workers in places like the Savannah River Site</span>.</p>
