                <p>Many consider slavery American’s original sin. U.S. history has been shaped by efforts to make the claim in the Constitution, that “all men are created equal,” true. Yet progress has not been linear, nor rapid.  Emancipation and the Civil War led to the brief optimism of Reconstruction, followed by Jim Crow laws, pervasive discrimination, and lynchings. Progress again with the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts in the 1960s has been followed by mass incarceration and ongoing racist attacks against African Americans.

                <p>After the war, the U.S. and the Soviet Union went from allies to competitors on the world stage, working to increase their global influence by furthering democracy and communism, respectively. America realized the inherent contradiction in their promotion of global democracy while African Americans at home remained subject to the Jim Crow system. In an effort to control the global narrative, the United States weaponized the State Department, working to silence black entertainers and intellectuals who shared the realities of their experience internationally.

                <p>Despite their wartime allyship, the relationship between the U.S. and Soviet Union had long been strained. Americans were suspicious of Soviet communism and Joseph Stalin. The Soviets resented the U.S. for their refusal to treat the U.S.S.R. as a legitimate player on the international stage. This animosity evolved into an extended period of competition and hostility. The U.S. focused on containing Soviet communist influence, relying heavily on military force to do so.

At the same time, the nuclear establishment felt as if it were above the fray, since most of the protests centered on militarism at the close of the Vietnam War. But one strand emerged and remains powerful to this day: the trade-off between spending money on an arsenal of weapons and spending money to ease the burdens of the poor, the disenfranchised, and the underrepresented.</p>

                <p>This period saw an upsurge in nuclear activism in Europe, where the NATO coalition experienced severe strain because of internal political pressure: residents of European countries were acutely aware that World War III would begin and end on their continent.

                <h3 class="section_heading">Conclusion</h3>
                <p>For over 70 years, Russia has used the U.S. failure to address its racial divisions as a way to tarnish the U.S. model, undermine U.S. global alliances, and most recently to undermine and destabilize U.S. democracy. Disinformation tactics have changed along with the rise of social media; they’ve become even more nuanced and difficult to detect. However they continue to leverage racial discord as their primary approach, specifically targeting African Americans and communities of color in their influence campaigns. The breadth and depth of the Russian attack on democracy over the last few years has been unprecedented—but our knowledge about what they’re doing, and how they are doing it, is increasing. Longtime leaders in connecting civil rights, democracy, and peace, African Americans are uniquely positioned to fight back against efforts to disenfranchise them at the expense of U.S. democracy.</p>
                <p>Bayard Ruskin, Martin Luther King, Macolm X, Barack Obama—along with the black leaders of today via the Movement for Black Lives and figures like John Lewis, Elijah Cummigs, Will Hurd, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and more—have all been working on the ever present American challenge of making the union a more perfect one.</p>
                <p>Fighting back against a new Cold War, attacks on democracy, and efforts to divide us based on race—this is a fight African American leaders know how to fight and win.</p>

                <p>Did you know that  African Americans have been at the forefront of the fight against nuclear weapons?</p>
                <p>In 1945, after American pilots destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki, killing tens of thousands of Japanese citizens in an instant, the poet Langston Hughes wrote that only ingrained racism could make a President so blind to the willful destruction of so many people of an entire race.</p>
                <p>Zora Neale Hurston called President Harry Truman “The BUTCHER OF ASIA.”</p>
                <p>20 years later, Malcom X, breaking bread with Japanese-American activists in Harlem, saw that they had been “scarred by the atom bomb. You just saw that we have also been scarred. The bomb that hit us was racism.”</p>
                <p>Three years later, a year before he was assassinated,  Martin Luther King told Nobel laureates that he “refused to accept the cynical notion that nation after nation must spiral down a militaristic stairway into the hell of thermonuclear destruction.”</p>
                <p>These protests were not in vain. In 1977, when it was reported that President Jimmy Carter had authorized research into the so-called “neutron bomb,”  thousands of African American women and men took to the streets in Washington, protesting the decision to divert health and human beings and towards weapons of war.  The protests were one of the reasons why that research was stopped.</p>
                <p>In 1982, Barack Obama, then at Columbia University in New York, was among the hundreds of thousands of activists who protested President Reagan’s military build-up, which included billions to “modernize” the nuclear arsenal.  Democrats won control of the House that fall, and Reagan’s ambitions were checked, at least for a while.</p>
                <p>Today, the United States plans to spend hundreds of billions of dollars over the next 10 years … again, to modernize the nuclear arsenal. But just half of that money… could ensure that every black mother in America has access to top-notch maternity care for decades to come… it could fund educational programs that teach young men and women about global citizenship… a fraction of that money could ensure that everyone, everywhere, can exercise their right to vote freely and securely.</p>
                <p>Your voice counts. Make sure that presidential candidates hear it.</p>

                <p>In order to get the result they wanted from the 2016 election, the Russian government turned an old trick. They picked at the scars of America’s original sin—racial animus—setting Americans against one another, but with a clear and ugly undertone: they tried to get black Americans not to vote.</p>
                <p>The Russians knew they could influence American opinion by suppressing the black vote, because it worked to their advantage before. During the Cold War, the Russian line was that America was hypocritical; it could not spread the cause of freedom around the world while it brutally subjugated the rights of its own people. Russians didn’t really care about racial harmony and progress. Their main goal was chaos—to split people into groups.</p>
                <p>Russia tried to tell black people how to vote then—and they’re doing it again now.</p>
                <p>Their interests found common cause with a growing movement to disenfranchise black voters in states where candidates of color can win elections.</p>
                <p>Candidates who support social justice don’t get a fair shake when you don’t vote.</p>
                <p>Candidates who support militarism, who threaten to nuke other countries into oblivion, who pull money away from health care, maternity coverage, and education, and use it instead on new bombers and new missiles.</p>
                <p>It’s time to reclaim your voice. If you care, share this message.</p>

                <p class="left">President Obama made reducing the nuclear risk a key element of his presidency. He had some important successes, including the New START Treaty with Russia, the Iran nuclear deal and the Nuclear Security Summit process to secure the materials that go into nuclear weapons. He also left office with several nuclear challenges outstanding, including plans to modernize the U.S. nuclear infrastructure, North Korean nuclear threats, and tensions with Russia. Like other African American leaders before him, Obama drew a clear connection between civil rights and the fight against war and nuclear weapons.</p>
                <p class="quote">“<span class="media_trigger" data-media-index="06.01" data-media-type="online_video" data-media-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AORo-YEXxNQ" data-media-alt="2009 Nobel Peace Prize Lecture by Barack Obama" data-media-source="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AORo-YEXxNQ" data-media-note="2009 Nobel Peace Prize Lecture by Barack Obama">I make this statement</span> mindful of what Martin Luther King Jr. said in this same ceremony years ago: “Violence never brings permanent peace. It solves no social problem: it merely creates new and more complicated ones.” As someone who stands here as a direct consequence of Dr. King’s life work, I am living testimony to the moral force of non-violence. I know there’s nothing weak—nothing passive, nothing naïve—in the creed and lives of Gandhi and King.</p>
                <p class="quote">But we do not have to think that human nature is perfect for us to still believe that the human condition can be perfected. We do not have to live in an idealized world to still reach for those ideals that will make it a better place. The non-violence practiced by men like Gandhi and King may not have been practical or possible in every circumstance, but the love that they preached—their fundamental faith in human progress—that must always be the North Star that guides us on our journey.</p>
                <p class="quote">We can acknowledge that oppression will always be with us, and still strive for justice. We can admit the intractability of deprivation, and still strive for dignity. Clear-eyed, we can understand that there will be war, and still strive for peace. We can do that—for that is the story of human progress; that’s the hope of all the world; and at this moment of challenge, that must be our work here on Earth.”</p>
                <p class="left">Obama teed up his commitment to a world free of nuclear weapons early in his Administration with a <span class="media_trigger" data-media-index="06.02" data-media-type="online_video" data-media-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uYcAr0ZDSlg" data-media-alt="Obama's Prague Speech on Disarmament" data-media-source="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYcAr0ZDSlg" data-media-note="Obama's Prague Speech on Disarmament">speech in Prague</span> in the spring of 2009 where he again drew the through-line:</p>
                <p class="quote">“The existence of thousands of nuclear weapons is the most dangerous legacy of the Cold War. No nuclear war was fought between the United States and the Soviet Union, but generations lived with the knowledge that their world could be erased in a single flash of light. Cities like Prague that existed for centuries, that embodied the beauty and the talent of so much of humanity, would have ceased to exist.</p>
                <p class="quote">Today, the Cold War has disappeared but thousands of those weapons have not. In a strange turn of history, the threat of global nuclear war has gone down, but the risk of a nuclear attack has gone up.</p>
                <p class="quote">Now, understand, this matters to people everywhere. One nuclear weapon exploded in one city—be it New York or Moscow, Islamabad or Mumbai, Tokyo or Tel Aviv, Paris or Prague—could kill hundreds of thousands of people. And no matter where it happens, there is no end to what the consequences might be—for our global safety, our security, our society, our economy, to our ultimate survival.</p>
                <p class="quote">Just as we stood for freedom in the 20th century, we must stand together for the right of people everywhere to live free from fear in the 21st century. And as the only nuclear power to have used a nuclear weapon, the United States has a moral responsibility to act.</p>
                <p class="quote">So today, I state clearly and with conviction America's commitment to seek the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons. I'm not naive. This goal will not be reached quickly—perhaps not in my lifetime. It will take patience and persistence. But now we, too, must ignore the voices who tell us that the world cannot change. We have to insist, ‘Yes, we can.’</p>
                <p class="quote">When nations and peoples allow themselves to be defined by their differences, the gulf between them widens. When we fail to pursue peace, then it stays forever beyond our grasp. We know the path when we choose fear over hope. To denounce or shrug off a call for cooperation is an easy but also a cowardly thing to do. That's how wars begin. That's where human progress ends.”</p>

There, he continued to argue for the elimination of nuclear weapons.</p>
                <p class="quote">“Yet in the image of a mushroom cloud that rose into these skies, we are most starkly reminded of humanity’s core contradiction. How the very spark that marks us as a species, our thoughts, our imagination, our language, our toolmaking, our ability to set ourselves apart from nature and bend it to our will—those very things also give us the capacity for unmatched destruction.</p>
                <p class="quote">How often does material advancement or social innovation blind us to this truth. How easily we learn to justify violence in the name of some higher cause. Every great religion promises a pathway to love and peace and righteousness, and yet no religion has been spared from believers who have claimed their faith as a license to kill. Nations arise, telling a story that binds people together in sacrifice and cooperation, allowing for remarkable feats, but those same stories have so often been used to oppress and dehumanize those who are different.</p>
                <p class="quote">We may not be able to eliminate man’s capacity to do evil, so nations—and the alliances that we’ve formed—must possess the means to defend ourselves. But among those nations like my own that hold nuclear stockpiles, we must have the courage to escape the logic of fear, and pursue a world without them.</p>
                <p class="quote">We’re not bound by genetic code to repeat the mistakes of the past. We can learn. We can choose. We can tell our children a different story—one that describes a common humanity; one that makes war less likely and cruelty less easily accepted.</p>
                <p class="quote">“My own nation’s story began with simple words: All men are created equal, and endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights, including life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Realizing that ideal has never been easy, even within our own borders, even among our own citizens.”</p>
                <p class="quote">But staying true to that story is worth the effort. It is an ideal to be strived for; an ideal that extends across continents, and across oceans. The irreducible worth of every person, the insistence that every life is precious; the radical and necessary notion that we are part of a single human family—that is the story that we all must tell.”</p>
                <p class="left">President Obama carried forward the leadership on nuclear disarmament that was born in the African American community at the dawn of the nuclear age. But as he himself acknowledged, the effort to rid the world of these incredibly dangerous weapons will continue. Look no further than the current Administration’s backtracking on the Iran nuclear deal and elevating the role of nuclear weapons again in U.S. strategic thinking. We’re on the road to a new nuclear arms race and a new Cold War. We need to build on the legacy of African American leadership in this arena to continue to push for peace.</p>

                <h1 class="article_title">Project Outcomes and Futures</h1>
                <h3 class="section_heading">Origins</h3>
                <p>This project grew out of the observation that while race, poverty, and anti-war elements were all part of the civil rights movement in the 1960s, today’s push for economic and social justice has not wholly embraced the fight for peace. In the face of an Administration that has talked up the value of nuclear weapons and threatened a new arms race, this silence is troubling.</p>
                <h3 class="section_heading">Outcomes</h3>
                <p>The initial research effort you see on these pages has simply been designed to draw a through-line between the civil rights and anti-militarization work of the 1960s to modern realities, as well as emphasize the connections between social justice and peace. We hope it serves as a starting point for deeper conversations about the connection between social justice, militarism and the importance of avoiding a new nuclear arms race. No one benefits from building weapons we cannot use, and there are significant opportunity costs of allocating federal resources this way.</p>
                <h3 class="section_heading">Research Futures</h3>
                <p>One of the key take-aways from this research was the difficulty in making the case to the African American community for a foreign policy focus in their activism in the face of overwhelming domestic challenges - from excessive force by the police, to voter suppression, to securing quality education for students of color. One path for further investigation is making the connections between these issues and nuclear weapons investment more salient - particularly on issues of economics and environmental justice.</p>
                <h3 class="section_heading">Spatial Futures</h3>
                <p class="quote"><span class="media_trigger" data-media-index="07.00" data-media-type="website" data-media-url="http://simuseo.net/assets/sim110.pdf" data-media-alt="" data-media-source="http://simuseo.net/assets/sim110.pdf" data-media-note="Quote from: Stogner, Maggie Burnette. 'The Immersive Cultural Museum Experience--Creating Context and Story with New Media Technology'. International Journal of the Inclusive Museum 3.3 (2011).">“Twenty-First Century Media technologies have excellent potential to create immersive storytelling for cultural exhibitions by heightening sensory engagement and by forging deeper cognitive and emotional contextual connections with artifacts and objects.”</span></p>
                <p class="quote">—Maggie Burnette Stogner</p>
                <p>How do we take this research and turn it into something immersive, something that builds understanding but also empathy? In other words, how do we make it real for those we hope to reach? One approach—and potentially a future direction for the project—is a multimedia exhibition.</p>
                <p>Museums have hosted similarly themed projects in the past, including a <span class="media_trigger" data-media-index="07.01" data-media-type="website" data-media-url="https://thebulletin.org/doomsday-clock/museum-exhibit/" data-media-alt="" data-media-source="https://thebulletin.org/doomsday-clock/museum-exhibit/" data-media-note="">Bulletin of Atomic Scientists exhibition</span> at the <span class="media_trigger" data-media-index="07.02" data-media-type="online_video" data-media-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HsAIvpudJTY" data-media-alt="MSI Asks Episode 05: Rachel Bronson" data-media-source="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsAIvpudJTY" data-media-note="MSI Asks Episode 05: Rachel Bronson">Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago</span>. But while that project focused exclusively on the history of the <span class="media_trigger" data-media-index="07.03" data-media-type="online_video" data-media-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jCnWPbn-ZKo" data-media-alt="The Doomsday Clock, explained" data-media-source="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCnWPbn-ZKo" data-media-note="The Doomsday Clock, explained">Doomsday Clock</span>, an exhibition exploring the intersection of civil rights, disarmament, and disinformation must also highlight the connection between the individual, the community, and the international. And thus, the challenge is representing the individual amidst the geopolitical while at the same time relating the geopolitical back to the individual.</p>
                <p>While the themes and content of the project live naturally in this digital environment, they are likewise well-suited to an <span class="media_trigger" data-media-index="07.04" data-media-type="image" data-media-url="https://infoscope.gr/sites/default/files/field/image/Interaction.Jpg" data-media-alt="Interactive Exhibition" data-media-source="https://infoscope.gr/sites/default/files/field/image/Interaction.Jpg" data-media-note="">interactive exhibition</span>—one focused on sensemaking for target audiences and storytelling through the eyes of individuals, families and communities, all the while positioning the content within its wider socio-political context. Imagine walking into an <span class="media_trigger" data-media-index="07.05" data-media-type="image" data-media-url="https://api.hub.jhu.edu/factory/sites/default/files/styles/hub_xlarge/public/gabo_impact_060418.jpg?itok=j5_M6P4v" data-media-alt="Immersive Virtual Reality Exhibition" data-media-source="https://api.hub.jhu.edu/factory/sites/default/files/styles/hub_xlarge/public/gabo_impact_060418.jpg?itok=j5_M6P4v" data-media-note="">immersive 360º space</span>, surrounded by real-world footage of a police force advancing on demonstrators in urban America. This kind of polyphonic multimedia exhibition calls on parallel perspectives and forgotten histories, highlighting where the distortion and disinformation occurs during cultural translation, governmental manipulation, political spin, and social media confusion. Unlike more traditional and static exhibitions, the polyphonic multimedia approach is aimed at building understanding through the power of narrative to engage audiences emotionally—to make them care about a subject, not just to learn about it.</p>
                <p>This is an educational endeavour, and one premised on interaction and immersion. In this sense it’s similar to <span class="media_trigger" data-media-index="07.06" data-media-type="online_video" data-media-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4wjX6RHHpNw" data-media-alt="The Bomb, Trailer" data-media-source="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wjX6RHHpNw" data-media-note="The Bomb Trailer">The Bomb</span>, a nuclear-themed <span class="media_trigger" data-media-index="07.07" data-media-type="image" data-media-url="https://s3.amazonaws.com/tribeca_cms_production/uploads/article/header_marquee/570bf0b05efe1d410e000001/large_full_TFF16_4.23-The_BOMB_jessicafoley-_fauxly-web.jpg" data-media-alt="Live performance of The Bomb" data-media-source="http://thebombnow.com/" data-media-note="The Bomb is a groundbreaking multimedia installation that immerses you in the strange, compelling, and unsettling reality of nuclear weapons.">immersive film, music, and art installation</span> partly funded by NSquare.
